# college_expenses

Theme: Using Machine Learning to solve local community problems

We wanted to use Machine Learning to help college students predict their monthly expenses. This would be a great impact to college students because they will be able to know their expenses ahead of time and save accordingly.
We used "University Students Monthly Expenses" from Kaggle for our datasets. 
We collected the data of their monthly expenses and predicted how much they will spend on the future depending on the Student Year, Living, Scholarship, Part Time Job, Transportation, Drinks, Sosmethics & Self-care, and Monthly Subscription. 
The elements we used were Kaggle, VS Code, and Juptyer Notebook.
